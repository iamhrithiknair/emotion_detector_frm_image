# emotion_detector_frm_image
This repository contains code that uses the DeepFace library to detect emotions in an image. This code can be used as a starting point for building emotion detection applications using DeepFace and OpenCV.
Before running the code, there are certain packages that needed to be installed if not already installed. 
For that, use pip package_name in the cmd. eg: pip matplotlib.pyplot
An error that is often seen: "UnicodeDecodError",which occurs when trying to decode a byte string containing non-ASCII characters into a Unicode string. For that change the backslashes in the "img1 = cv2.imread('C:/Users/hrith/Downloads/rdj2.jpg')" to double forwardslashes \\.
